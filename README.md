# AskMeAnything

Hello there,

This is a project for a university class. It is a fully functional web app that implements a forum.
You can register, login and start interacting with other users by asking or answering.

In order to run this app you will need to clone the repository.

Open a terminal and inside the backend folder you have to run:
  node app.js
Open another terminal and inside the frontend folder run:
  npm start

Hopefully the servers must be online. You can now access http://localhost:3000/ and start playing.
ENJOY!!
